In fact, as per the TIOBE index, Python was the \r\n<b><a href=\"https://content.techgig.com/python-is-the-programming-language-of-the-year-for-2018/articleshow/67459231.cms\">programming language of the year in 2018</a></b>.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> One of the reasons for the popularity of this open source programming language is its simplicity and the fact that it has a short learning curve for a programmer. Today, \r\n<b><a href=\"https://content.techgig.com/why-you-should-use-python-for-ai-and-machine-learning/articleshow/69073649.cms\">Python is used extensively for AI and machine learning</a></b>.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> A high-performance and dynamic programming language that is now challenging the dominance of Python is <keyword keytype=\"person\" smid=\"0\" usetype=\"2\" keywordseo=\"Julia\" actualkeyword=\"Julia\">Julia</keyword> programming language. First unveiled to developers in 2012 by MIT Professors Viral Shah, Stefan Karpinski, Jeff Bezanson, and Alan Edelman, the programming language made its official debut in 2018 when Julia 1.0 was released at <keyword keytype=\"person\" smid=\"0\" usetype=\"2\" keywordseo=\"JuliaCon\" actualkeyword=\"JuliaCon\">JuliaCon</keyword> conference in London.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"articlevideo youtube-embed\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1jN5wKvN-Uk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> \r\n<br>Julia is designed for speed and to be used for high performance computing requirements. The programming language leverages the positive aspects of similar <keyword keytype=\"person\" smid=\"0\" usetype=\"2\" keywordseo=\"programming-languages\" actualkeyword=\"programming languages\">programming languages</keyword> like Python as well as eliminate their shortcomings. Some of the features of Julia programming language include: \r\n<br>\r\n<br> #1. Built for speed as it is compiled at Just-In-Time or runtime using the LLVM framework. The fact that it is not interpreted makes it a fast programming language and ideal for machine learning and AI-related activities.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> #2. Julia is a dynamically typed programming language where you don’t have to specify variables.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> #3. While using Julia you can access the libraries of other programming languages such as C and Python.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> #4. The metaprogramming ability of Julia programming language allows developers to create a Julia programs from another Julia program with unique codes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Key features of Python:<br></strong>\r\n<br> #1. Python is a high-level and object-oriented programming language.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> #2. Python is also a dynamically typed language like Julia.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> #3. There is no need to compile Python as it is an interpreted language.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> #4. Python is an open source language and you can download and use it freely.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> #5. Python programming language is highly portable and can run on any machine.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br> \r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\n<br>\r\n<br> The jury is still out on whether Julia programming language will be able to outperform Python in the long run and become the go-to programming language for programmers to build high performance computational projects using AI and machine learning. \r\n<br>\r\n<br> The fact that linear algebra and matrix representations can be quickly executed in Julia programming language means that it is faster in execution than Python. Code conversion is another area where Julia has an edge over Python. Code conversion is much easier and faster while converting Python and C to Julia than the other way around.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> Another fact that Python is much older than Julia works to its advantage, as Python has a bigger and more active community. Julia, being a relatively new programming language has a smaller community and therefore it is at a disadvantageous position over Python which is also supported by more third-party libraries.\r\n</div></div></div>', 'Julia vs. Python', '2019-06-06 21:00:23', 'juliavspython.jpg'),

The US Labor Secretary has proposed to hike the fees for H-1B visa program last month.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> It was in April 2017, that the US President Donald Trump had signed the ‘Buy American and Hire American’ executive order. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has intensified the scrutiny on the H-1B visa program ever since. With the declining number of approvals and increased cost of H-1B application, US-based employers will have to significantly reduce their dependency on the foreign skilled workers.\r\n</div></div></div>', 'H-1B woes', '2019-06-06 23:40:54', 'h1b.jpg'),

The macOS Catalina users now get three separate apps - Music, Podcasts, and TV. Apple has also added a special page within the macOS\'s Finder for syncing iPhones, iPads, and iPods. Another interesting feature in the new macOS is Sidecar. You can now use an iPad as a second screen for your MacBook.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At WWDC 2019, Apple has announced the introduction of a new SSO feature that allows Apple users to sign-in on third-party apps using their Apple credentials. The ‘Sign In with Apple’ feature will directly compete with the likes of Google and Facebook which allows a similar feature. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been very vocal about the data privacy issues that big tech companies like Facebook have failed to address, With this move, Apple is doing its bit to answer the growing data privacy concerns as anyone using this feature will only be sharing the minimum personal data with the third-party apps.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> \r\n<b>iOS 13</b>\r\n<br>\r\n<br> The company made it official that dark mode is coming to iOS 13.
